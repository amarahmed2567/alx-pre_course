INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWED TO CREATE THIS REPOSITORY

REPO SESSION

Create a new directory called 0x01-git in your alx-pre_course repo. Make sure you include a non empty README.md in your directory: at the root of your repository alx-pre_course. AND in the directory 0x01-git. And important part: Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.

CODING FURY ROAD

For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code! Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js Create these empty files: c/c_is_fun.c js/main.js js/index.js Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX" Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School" Add all these new files to git Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server

COLLABORATION IS THE BASE OF A COMPANY A branch is like a copy of your project. It’s used mainly for:

adding a feature in development. collaborating on the same project with other developers. not breaking your entire repository. not upsetting your co-workers. The purpose of a branch is to isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers’ work. For this project, create a branch update_script and in this branch:

Create an empty file named bash/98. Update bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School". Update bash/school by replacing echo "School" with echo "The school is open!". Add and commit these changes (message: “My personal work”). Push this new branch. Perfect! You did an amazing update in your project and it’s isolated correctly from the main branch. Ho wait, your manager needs a quick fix in your project and it needs to be deployed now:

Change branch to main. Update the file bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School is so cool!". Delete the directory js. Commit your changes (message: “Hot fix”) and push to the origin. COLLABORATION: BE UP TO DATE

Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s best if you keep up to date with their changes. For this task – and only for this task – please update your file README.md in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.

After you have done that, in your terminal:

Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your README.md file will be updated). Create a new file up_to_date at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used. Add up_to_date to git, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”), and push to the origin.
